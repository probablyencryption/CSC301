# CSC 301 - Recursive Problems Solution

## Function Explanations

### 1. Factorial Calculation
**Base Case:** `factorial(0) = 1` and `factorial(1) = 1`
- These are the terminating conditions that stop the recursion

**Recursive Case:** `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)` for n > 1
- Each recursive call reduces the problem size by 1 until reaching the base case

### 2. Fibonacci Sequence
**Base Cases:** `fibonacci(0) = 0` and `fibonacci(1) = 1`
- These define the first two Fibonacci numbers

**Recursive Case:** `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)` for n > 1
- Each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers

### 3. String Reversal
**Base Case:** Empty string or single character returns itself
- No further processing needed for strings of length â‰¤ 1

**Recursive Case:** `reverse(str) = last_char + reverse(str_without_last_char)`
- Takes the last character and concatenates it with the reverse of the remaining string

### 4. Binary Search
**Base Case:** `low > high` returns -1 (element not found)
- Search space is exhausted without finding the target

**Recursive Case:** Compare middle element with target and search appropriate half
- Divides the search space in half with each recursive call

## Recursion vs Iterative Approaches

Recursion and iteration are two fundamental programming paradigms for solving repetitive problems. **Recursion** excels in problems with self-similar substructures, such as tree traversals, mathematical sequences, and divide-and-conquer algorithms. It provides elegant, readable code that closely mirrors mathematical definitions. However, recursion typically consumes more memory due to function call overhead and may suffer from performance issues in cases like naive Fibonacci implementation.

**Iterative approaches** generally offer better space efficiency and performance, using loops instead of function calls. They avoid stack overflow risks and provide more predictable memory usage. However, iterative solutions can be more complex for naturally recursive problems.

**Recursion is preferred** when the problem has a clear recursive structure (like tree operations), when code clarity is prioritized over performance, or when implementing divide-and-conquer algorithms. Iteration is better for simple counting operations, when memory is constrained, or when maximum performance is required.
